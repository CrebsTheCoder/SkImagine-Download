# SkImagine

SkImagine is an addon with similar elements like [SkBee](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee), the key main difference
is the lack of some features such as what's listed below in the table, these are only the elements with toggles not all syntax, more could be missing from the code that's always forced loaded.


SkImagine was made for mostly a stripped down version of [SkBee](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee) and for testing changes to code without explicitly adding to [SkBee](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee) these changes include but are not limited to recipe sections based on expressions and effects, nbt no longer supporting references and merchant villager sections.


# What versions are supported
Latest, I couldn't give a rat's ass about your 1.20.4 minecraft server, 1.20.5+ is where money is at, so 1.21+ is the logical solution.
